SECTION - Why do we do prostate biopsies?

Doctors screen for prostate cancer with a blood test called PSA and a rectal exam. These tests help decide who should have more tests. A biopsy is the main way that we diagnose prostate cancer. <u>These are your results:</u>

SECTION - Q2. What is the grade of the cancer?

Grade tells us how aggressive the tumor cells look under the microscope.
Cancers with a higher score are more likely to multiply and spread. In prostate cancer the grade is known as the Gleason Score. This score is made up of two numbers ranging from 3 to 5. The first number shows the most common grade under the microscope and the second number is the next most common grade. The scale starts at Gleason score 3 + 3 = 6 (lowest grade) to Gleason score 5 + 5 = 10 (highest grade).<br /><b>YOUR GLEASON SCORE IS: |||gleason_score|||</b>.

SECTION - Q3. How much cancer is there?

To understand how much of your prostate is involved by cancer, we look at how much of each biopsy sample had cancer. You had cancer in <u><b>|||cores|||% of your biopsy samples.</b></u>
